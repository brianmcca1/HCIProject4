Project 4: Brian McCarthy
To run this project, run Main.jav as a Java application. From the home page you can navigate to any of the 4 man pages implemented.
The project is almost completely dynamic; adding any new man pages to the XML should be handled properly by the system.

Moving to the next page in the Flags section, noticeable in the flags of "ls", is not fully implemented due to some 
issues with the implementation of the ManPage map. However, it should be clear how that would work. The Next button is 
marked as such

Note: Sometimes clicking on the links to other pages does not result in an immediate response, and sometimes the links require 
multiple clicks. As far as I can tell, this is a limitation of how Swing implements MouseEvents. If you hold the mouse button down for too long, it
doesn't recognize that as a "mouseClicked" event. Not sure if there's any way to avoid that.
